# Spanish_Tutor
A simple program that could really help you learn spanish. It's effect would be best felt from an IB Spanish ab initio student's point of view,
but that doesn't have to stop you in any way.

### Key features
This is not a typical tutoring program that would give you step by step learning advise. It consists of modules on different topics which in future version
releases would act like a compact quiz program and summarizer program.
For now, this program can ask you some direct translations and simple questions.

### Usage Instructions
The file main2.py is the main file, which if ran, attempts to load data from csv files in the same directory. The specifics of these files can be configured by the first couple of lines of code in the main file (where information is stored in the form of a dict).

### Adding Files
As mentioned, the dict must be edited to reconf the files data.

### Types of Questions
Right now, the code has some rudimentary capacity to present the user with sentence type questions. Otherwise, the questions are mainly single-word type questions that work best jogging up vocab or simple facts.
